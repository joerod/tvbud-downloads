# TVBud APK downloads

This repository hosts Android TV and Fire TV APK downloads for TVBud. The app does not include any channels or playlists.

Create one reusable Downloader code for each URL at [go.aftvnews.com](https://go.aftvnews.com/):

| Channel | Current version | APK URL |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Production baseline | 0.3.2 | https://github.com/joerod/tvbud-downloads/releases/download/fire-tv-prod/TVBud-FireTV.apk |
| Development | 0.3.26 | https://github.com/joerod/tvbud-downloads/releases/download/fire-tv-current-test/TVBud-FireTV.apk |

The two asset URLs stay the same when their APKs are updated. The user confirmed Browser Manager HTTPS works. Version 0.3.26 keeps the Groups drill-down and makes Hide group hide all its channels, while showing the group restores them all. The Skins tab now lines up Apply buttons across every row. Config, Groups, and Skins tabs also support JSON config and skin transfer, channel search and Favorites, and an online XMLTV fallback URL per playlist. The app starts in single view and clears extra screens unless the user enables **Reopen my multiview screens each time**. Provider playback and the updated remote navigation still need Fire Stick testing. The production baseline still needs full Fire Stick testing. TiviMate `.tmb` backup import is not yet supported.

See the [releases](https://github.com/joerod/tvbud-downloads/releases) for downloads.
